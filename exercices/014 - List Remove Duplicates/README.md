## List Remove Duplicates ðŸš€ðŸš€

Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

Extras:

- Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
- Go back and do [Exercise 5](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/05/05-list-overlap.html) using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.
