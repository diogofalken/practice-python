## Guessing Game One 🚀🚀🚀

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very [*first exercise*](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html))

Extras:

- Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
- Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
